        <h1>You just got phished!</h1>
        <p>
            Somebody sent you to a fake webpage made with DrillPhish to fool you
            into giving away your credentials. Your credentials were not stored or
            stolen, but they could have been!
        </p>
        <p>
            If the person that sent you here configured DrillPhish to do so, your
            actions on the previous page will have been recorded in a remote log.

        <h2>What is phishing?</h2>
        <p>From Wiktionary:</p>
        <blockquote>
            The act of sending email that falsely claims to be from a legitimate
            organization. This is usually combined with a threat or request for
            information: for example, that an account will close, a balance is due,
            or information is missing from an account. The email will ask the
            recipient to supply confidential information, such as bank account
            details, PINs or passwords; these details are then used by the owners
            of the website to conduct fraud.
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How can I tell if I am getting phished?</h2>
        <p>
            There are no ways of identifying phishing that work one hundred
            percent of the time, but there are things you can look out for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A call to immediate action</li>
            <li>Grammatic or typographic errors</li>
            <li>Deceptive Hyperlinks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these are explained below.
        </p>
        <h2>The Signs of Phishing, Explained</h2>
        <h3>A Call to Immediate Action</h3>
        <p>
            Phishing emails will often lure you into acting irrationally by
            fostering a sense of urgency. They will often do this by
            threatening the closure of an account, the levy of a hefty fee,
            legal action or other vexations if you do not click on a link
            and do <i>something</i> within an short deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
            This deadline is often far more imminent than most legitimate
            organizations would impose. For example, most organizations that
            would charge a fee of some kind would typically give a few days
            of warning prior to doing so. A phishing email, on the other hand,
            might say that you have 12 hours to log in to "update your
            settings," to avoid the charge.
        </p>
        <h3>Grammatic or Typographic Errors</h3>
        <p>
            Face it: statistically speaking, most people on the planet, and,
            hence, on the Internet, are not from your home country, and do not
            speak your native language. Ceteris Paribus, you should expect that
            emails from foreign countries would have more typographic or
            grammatic errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            For that matter, most legitimate organizations that will contact
            you through email will put their communications through
            professional scrutiny, which will filter out typographic errors
            and grammatic errors--the mistakes of a non-native tongue
            notwithstanding.
        </p>
        <h3>Deceptive Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>
            Phishing emails will usually link you to a website via a
            clickable hyperlink. In most cases, these hyperlinks are blue
            and underlined to indicate that they are hyperlinks. The text
            that you see for a hyperlink can differ from the actual thing
            to which it links.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, a link might read
            <code>http://good-site.com</code>, but actually direct you
            to <code>http://bad-site.com</code>. In a typical web browser or
            email client, when you hover over a hyperlink, you will see the
            actual thing it links to in a bottom corner of the page. If what
            you see does not match the <em>domain name</em> of the URL it is
            linking to, it <em>might</em> be phishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that it is normal for emails to link you to long URLs that
            contain a lot of random characters. What really matters is who
            owns the <em>domain</em> you are being sent to--not the stuff
            that comes after it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is an example of a deceptive hyperlink. Try hovering over it
            to see if you can see what it <em>actually</em> links to.

        <h2>Phishing Email Examples</h2>
        <h3>Obvious</h3>
        <pre>
            Henlo honey,please to meet you. Your acount will expire in three
            days if you do'nt log in here:
            <a href="https://gotcha.drillphish.com">http://facebook.com</a>.

            Yours In God's Love,
            - facebook company
        </pre>
        <h3>Passable</h3>
        <pre>
            Attention Facebook user! Your account is soon to expire if you do
            not log in and udpate your security settings. Click
            <a href="https://gotcha.drillphish.com">this link</a> to update
            your security settings to avoid the expiration of your account.

        </pre>
        <p>
            This email is much less obvious than the first, but it does have
            one subtle hint: the phisher transposed the letters "d" and "p"
            in the first occurrence of the word "update." The real Facebook
            would almost certainly not have such a typo in an email.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further abnormalities in this email are the fact that this fake
            Facebook did not call you by name, but rather, just referred to
            you as "Facebook user." For that matter, the circumstances of the
            email itself are suspicious: do you really think that Facebook
            would delete your account just because you did not update some
            security setting?
        </p>
        <h3>Crafty</h3>
        <p>
            A truly crafty phishing email will include personal information
            about you, have no typographic or grammatic errors, and create
            a believable scenario that requires you to log in. The clever
            email below actually has two phishing links.

        <h2>What do I do if I am getting phished?</h2>
        <p>
            At the very least, do not supply your credentials to the website.
            If you are uncertain if something is phishing, get a second
            opinion, preferrably from a cybersecurity officer, if your
            organization has one. If this is not available to you, you can
            try calling the organization that sent you the email to confirm
            whether or not it is normal for them to send out such an email.
            Finally, you should report anything suspicious to your
            organization's cybersecurity department, if it has one.
